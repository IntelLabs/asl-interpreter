synopsis: "Interpreter for Architecture Specification Language (ASL)"
description: """
Architecture Specification Language (ASL) is an executable language for writing
clear, precise specifications of Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs).

The ASL interpreter (ASLi) is an implementation of ASL that can execute ASL
specifications either in an interpreter or by compiling via C code.

Currently supports reading/typechecking the specification,
interactive execution of ASL statements and expressions,
executing opcodes one at a time,
loading ELF files and executing binaries.

Experimentally includes support for generating C code
that can be used to execute binaries faster and can be
linked with other C/C++ libraries.
