  (synopsis "Interpreter for Architecture Specification Language (ASL)")
  (description "\| Architecture Specification Language (ASL) is an executable language for writing
               "\| clear, precise specifications of Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs).
               "\|
               "\| The ASL interpreter (ASLi) is an implementation of ASL that can execute ASL
               "\| specifications either in an interpreter or by compiling via C code.
               "\|
               "\| Currently supports reading/typechecking the specification,
               "\| interactive execution of ASL statements and expressions,
               "\| executing opcodes one at a time,
               "\| loading ELF files and executing binaries.
               "\|
               "\| Experimentally includes support for generating C code
               "\| that can be used to execute binaries faster and can be
               "\| linked with other C/C++ libraries.
